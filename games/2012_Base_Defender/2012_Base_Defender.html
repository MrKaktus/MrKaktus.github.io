**Base Defender**
*2012 (Blackberry OS 10, Z10)*

Second Elektronika game remake. This time we recreated game MG-13 „Explorers of Space” which is about protecting spaceship from missles shoot by attacking fighters. Funny thing about this game was fact that it uses exactly the same game mechanics like the one about wolf catching eggs, so I just needed to change sprite positions and sizes. Matt though needed to redraw whole display again which was very time consuming. I still don’t know why we called it „Base Defender” 🙂
