**Catch'em Eggz!**
*2012 (Blackberry OS 10, Z10)*

This game is first in the series of exact game remakes I‚Äôve done. This time I had chance to work with talented 2D artist [Mateusz Dzikowski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateuszdzikowski) that put a lot of effort in recreating exact look of original device and LCD display. We tried to be as accurate as possible, and as such Matt mimicked displays ‚Äûleaking crystals‚Äù look, where you can barely see disabled parts of display. He also added small shadows, that enabled crystals cast in original display. That introduced feeling of depth and display layered construction. On the code side, I‚Äôve mimicked original game microprocesor frequency that was dictating game speed. We found it‚Äôs osciloscope chart captured by some other fan of original Elektronika games. Matt created also special box to record clean sounds of original device without introducing any noise.

Later on, we discovered that there are fake shops that copy games description and mimick BlackBerry World. Funny part is that they report huge download rankings for games to lure people to buy on their site. When we first discovered that our game was sold in range of 10 to 50 million copies we felt that we are millionairs. Unfortunately reality check confirmed that it‚Äôs just a fake üòâ
