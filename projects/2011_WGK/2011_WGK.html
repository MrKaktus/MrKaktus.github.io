*2011-2014 (Polish Conference on Computer Games Development, Poland)*

I've decided to organize WGK, because back in 2010 there
was no conference dedicated to game industry in Poland. There were
small gatherings and game jams organized by indie developers and 
hobbyists, but there was no professional event for the industry itself.

In August of 2010 I volunteered as a conference associate during 
GDC Europe. This was my way to gain knowledge on how to organize
professional event on a big scale. I've then partnered with 
Technical University of Gdansk which provided the venue, and 
year later in 2011 first edition of the event took place.

I was responsible for acquiring sponsors and speakers, communication 
with companies and event promotion. Conference was a success from
the first edition, and was growing fast. I've quickly ended up 
managing team of 9 people and 30 volunteers.


Organization of the conference ended when I moved from Poland to USA in October of 2014.
