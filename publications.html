<br>*Apple's World Wide Developers Conference - WWDC 2018*

In this session I've described in detail new Metal APIs I've worked on, that were designed to optimize rendering of VR applications.
I've also discussed topic of advanced frame pacing, to further optimize CPU and GPU utilization of those apps.

„Beyound Real Sense – The Future without monitors with Virtual Working Environment”
<br>*Intel, Tech Summit / Tech Leadership Day, 2014*
<!--
16/05/2014
-->

As part of Tech Leadership Day at Intel I've described future working environment 
in which classic multi-monitor setups are completely removed, and replaced by single
VR headset. 

In such setup user is surrounded by spherical desktop on which he can 
place 2D windows of existing applications, or instantly preview 3D models 
rendered by those apps in desktops shared space. Windows and objects could also
be moved further away from the user into the background, to fully utilize 3D space.

This presentation was accompanied by tech demo, presenting such setup, using Oculus DK1
VR headset prototype and Creative Senz3D depth sensor developed by Intel. Depth sensor
was used to reconstruct in VR space user hands, as well as keyboard and mouse that user was holding.

Thinking about it now, it's incredible how this presentation was so much ahead of 
its time. It took us 10 more years before it would materialize in 
form of Apple Vision Pro and visionOS.

„Multithreaded rendering using OpenGL in Task Pooled Environment”
<br>*Polish Conference on Computer Games Development, Gdansk 2011*

Modern game engines are based on Task-Pooled solutions which gives ability to take full advantage of modern multi-core CPU's architectures. This gives freedom of asynchronous code execution and data processing, but it also introduces need, to deal with old single threaded OpenGL rendering model. This lecture shows concrete ways to solve this problem and to allow multithreaded asynchronous rendering with OpenGL.

„Implementation of Hybrid Real-Time Mesh Refinement algorithm”
<br>*VII National Conference on Engineering of Computer Games, Siedlce 2010*

This article covers the subject of real time terrain rendering techniques that take advantage of capabilities present in latest GPU’s. It focuses mostly on terrain generation that is based on sphere. There are described algorithms that evolved from ROAM and uses cubical projections of height map. This article also mentions topic of terrain mesh consistency and its multi resolution nature.

[„Comparision of spherical terrain visualization methods”](./publications/2010_Master_thesis/Magisterka.pdf target="_blank") 
<br>*Master Thesis, Gdansk 2010*

My master thesis that treats about terrain visualization methods with strong focus on spherical terrain visualizations. 
This publication is a conclusion of my research in that field.

„Rendering Planets in Real Time”
<br>*VI National Conference on Engineering of Computer Games, Siedlce 2009*

The goal of this article is to introduce techniques of dynamic creation and rendering of planets. It describes methods, which allow us present in real time, with any level of detail, surface of the planet. To achieve this, there are mentioned techniques like megatexturing, dynamic level of detail and others.
