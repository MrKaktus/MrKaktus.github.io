[US20230094658 - PROTECTED ACCESS TO RENDERING INFORMATION FOR ELECTRONIC DEVICES](https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US394373777)
<br>*Apple, 2022-Pending*

Aspects of the subject technology relate to electronic devices that can provide protected use of user-related information to applications, for generating user-specific outputs. The protected access may allow an application to process the user-related information within a processing environment of a processor that is separate from a primary processor of an electronic device. Within that processing environment, the application can utilize the user-related information to generate a user-specific output from the device. However, the application is prevented from extricating the user-related information, and information derived from the user-related information, from that processing environment.

[WO2016007027 - METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR UPDATING A SHADER PROGRAM BASED ON CURRENT STATE](https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2016007027)
<br>*Intel, 2014-2017*

An apparatus and method for updating a shader program based on a current state. For example, one embodiment of a method comprises: identifying a first plurality of instructions which are dependent on a non-orthogonal state (NOS); marking the each of the first plurality of instructions which are dependent on the NOS; detecting a current NOS; and dynamically patching the marked instructions for the current NOS.
