„Multithreaded rendering using OpenGL in Task Pooled Environment”
<br>*Polish Conference on Computer Games Development, Gdansk 2011*

Modern game engines are based on Task-Pooled solutions which gives ability to take full advantage of modern multi-core CPU's architectures. This gives freedom of asynchronous code execution and data processing, but it also introduces need, to deal with old single threaded OpenGL rendering model. This lecture shows concrete ways to solve this problem and to allow multithreaded asynchronous rendering with OpenGL.

„Hex based texture splatting for procedural terrain generation”
<br>*Game Developers Convention, Gdansk 2010*

„Implementation of Hybrid Real-Time Mesh Refinement algorithm”
<br>*VII National Conference on Engineering of Computer Games, Siedlce 2010*

This article covers the subject of real time terrain rendering techniques that take advantage of capabilities present in latest GPU’s. It focuses mostly on terrain generation that is based on sphere. There are described algorithms that evolved from ROAM and uses cubical projections of height map. This article also mentions topic of terrain mesh consistency and its multi resolution nature.

[„Comparision of spherical terrain visualization methods”](./publications/2010_Master_Thesis/Magisterka.pdf) 
<br>*Master Thesis, Gdansk 2010*

![](./publications/2010_Master_Thesis/application.png) 

My master thesis that treats about terrain visualization methods with strong focus on spherical terrain visualizations. 
This publication is a conclusion of my research in that field.

„Rendering Planets in Real Time”
<br>*VI National Conference on Engineering of Computer Games, Siedlce 2009*

The goal of this article is to introduce techniques of dynamic creation and rendering of planets. It describes methods, which allow us present in real time, with any level of detail, surface of the planet. To achieve this, there are mentioned techniques like megatexturing, dynamic level of detail and others.

[US20230094658 - PROTECTED ACCESS TO RENDERING INFORMATION FOR ELECTRONIC DEVICES](https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US394373777 target="_blank")
<br>*Apple, 2022-Pending*

Aspects of the subject technology relate to electronic devices that can provide protected use of user-related information to applications, for generating user-specific outputs. The protected access may allow an application to process the user-related information within a processing environment of a processor that is separate from a primary processor of an electronic device. Within that processing environment, the application can utilize the user-related information to generate a user-specific output from the device. However, the application is prevented from extricating the user-related information, and information derived from the user-related information, from that processing environment.

[WO2016007027 - METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR UPDATING A SHADER PROGRAM BASED ON CURRENT STATE](https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2016007027 target="_blank")
<br>*Intel, 2014-2017*

An apparatus and method for updating a shader program based on a current state. For example, one embodiment of a method comprises: identifying a first plurality of instructions which are dependent on a non-orthogonal state (NOS); marking the each of the first plurality of instructions which are dependent on the NOS; detecting a current NOS; and dynamically patching the marked instructions for the current NOS.
