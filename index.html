Hi there!

Little bit about me.
I've started to create computer games in the times when DOS was common operating system 
and textmode based games were quite popular. Lack of good graphics pushed me then to 
write my own graphic library – DosGL. But I still felt unsatissfied with boundaries 
set to it by DOS. Therefore I gone further in pursuit for speed on my 386 and wrote 
my own microkernel fully in assembly language. Goal at the time was to have thin OS 
focused around and optimized for games running on old HW.

That pursuit for speed and better graphics driver lead me forther into development
of my own game engine that I extensively used for many years for all my personal 
projects. 

Through those hobby games, I've

Today my specialization are graphic drivers. I’ve worked at Intel R&D for 7 years. 
After that I’ve moved to California where I live today. More about my career you 
will find on my LinkedIn profile, while here you will find much more details about
everything else that I worked on.
