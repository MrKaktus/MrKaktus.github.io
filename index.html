Hi there! 

Lets start with little bit about my work. I'm Staff Software Engineer with 17 years of experience in 
real-time computer graphics, XR and low-level programming. I've contributed to the design of major 
graphics APIs, including OpenGL, OpenGL ES, Direct3D, and Metal. Developed graphics drivers for Intel 
and Apple GPUs across Windows, macOS, and iOS platforms. Experienced in writing applications and games 
utilizing above, as well as game engines and renderers (latest utilizing Vulkan and Direct3D 12).

As Tech Lead for VR adoption on Apple products, I was working with Valve on porting SteamVR to macOS. 
Later on I've designed and lead implementation of Apple's real-time XR SW stack (Apple equivalent of 
OpenXR) for Macs and Vision Pro. 

Currently I'm working with AIML division on Apple Neural Engine (ANE) driver architecture (with focus 
on resources residency, workloads scheduling and dependency tracking).

More about my career you will find on my LinkedIn profile, while here you will find much more details 
about everything else that I worked on (both professionally as well as my personal projects).
